# Player Profile

![Cover Image](radar.jpeg)

On football_players_data.ipynb you can find how to get data from players from any league!  
In this case is for the Spanish La Liga ⚽️ midfielders players, but feel free to adapt it to any league and any field position.

The goal of the project is to build a Streamlit App (player_profile.py) where to visualize the player profile radar plot 🟢🍕 to see the players contribution to the team. 

Do not forget to check requirements.txt!
